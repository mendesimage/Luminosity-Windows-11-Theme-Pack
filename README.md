# Introduction

**Luminosity** is based on native Acrylic, using the maximum `TintLuminosityOpacity` value as its backdrop. Luminosity should give a modern look to your system.

It's meant to be used with **Mica** or **MicaAlt** backdrops, with or without the **Translucent Windows** mod.

\*Example images will be uploaded soon*
